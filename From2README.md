# Docker OpenWrt Builder

Build [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) images in a Docker container. This is sometimes necessary when building OpenWrt on the host system fails, e.g. when some dependency is too new.

The docker image is based on Ubuntu Linux.
Works with LEDE-17.01, OpenWrt-18.06 and newer.

A smaller container based on Alpine Linux is available in the alpine branch. But it does not build the old LEDE images.

## Prerequisites

* Docker installed
* running Docker daemon
* build Docker image:

```
git clone https://github.com/mwarning/docker-openwrt-builder.git
cd docker-openwrt-builder
docker build -t openwrt_builder .
```

Now the docker image is available. These steps only need to be done once.

## Usage

Create a build folder and link it into a new docker container:
```
mkdir ~/mybuild
docker run -v ~/mybuild:/home/user -it openwrt_builder /bin/bash
```

In the container console, enter:
```
git clone https://git.openwrt.org/openwrt/openwrt.git
cd openwrt
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
make menuconfig
make -j4
```

After the build, the images will be inside `~/mybuild/openwrt/bin/target/`.
